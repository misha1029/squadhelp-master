									across the globe. Most importantly, Squadhelp provides you with choice: you get to see ideas from
									dozens (in some cases, hundreds) of contestants before you select a winner. Typically, you would spend
									far less money with Squadhelp (our contests start at $199) than hiring an agency. Also, you will
